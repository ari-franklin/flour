# Multi-Altitude Product Roadmap

This project explores a simple but powerful concept: helping product teams visualize their work at different **altitudes of visibility** â€” from high-level strategic goals to week-by-week execution. Itâ€™s designed to be useful for a single team to start, with room to scale across multiple streams.

## âœ¨ Core Idea

Different stakeholders care about different levels of detail. This roadmap structure makes it easy to **zoom in or out** depending on what you need to see:

- **Zoomed Out**: Strategic Objective or Company Goal
- **Middle Altitude**: Outcome Roadmap with Now / Near / Next
- **Zoomed In**: Epic-level Bets and Initiatives linked to each outcome

Each *outcome* card acts as a bridge â€” it's shaped like a teamâ€™s focus area and cascades down to the detailed bets that deliver on it.
