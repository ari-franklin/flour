🧠 Concept Summary: Multi-Altitude View of Product Work

I'm trying to build a visual system that helps understand product work at different levels of visibility, from strategy down to execution, especially as it relates to teams.

⸻

**🎯 What I’m Trying to Build**

I’m creating a view that lets me understand and communicate product work at different altitudes — from long-term strategic outcomes to short-term tactical bets.

The core idea is that different stakeholders care about different levels of visibility. Some want to zoom out and see objectives or strategic outcomes; others want to zoom in on team-level initiatives or epic-level bets.

Eventually, I want to support multiple teams or streams, but I need to get it working well for a single team/unit first.

🧱 Initial Structure (Single-Team View)

Think of it as three connected levels:
	1.	Zoomed Out: Objective / Strategic Outcome
	•	High-level goals that a team is contributing to (quarterly OKRs or similar)
	•	One level above the outcome roadmap
	•	Optional to show
	2.	Outcome Roadmap (Middle Altitude)
	•	Core organizing view
	•	Shows Now / Near / Next outcomes — these are higher-level efforts, possibly quarterly
	•	Each outcome supports a zoomed-out objective
	•	These are team-shaped, cross-functional focuses
	3.	Zoomed In: Bets / Initiatives
	•	Under each outcome, there are 3–6 “bets” (epics or initiatives) the team might be working on weekly or monthly
	•	These are more actionable, detailed, and time-constrained
	•	Eventually, might be linked to metrics, but not yet
